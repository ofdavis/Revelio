## As the labor market cools, job postings are growing stale
Employers aren't rushing to fill vacancies anymore 


&nbsp;

* __With the labor market slowing, job seekers now encounter a growing share of listings that stay up for a month or more.__
* __Job postings have aged throughout the labor market, but especially for low- and mid-tier roles.__
* __The rise in job-ad durations is tied to declines in labor market churn, as more employees stay put and fewer vacancies open up.__

By now, the story of the post-pandemic U.S. labor market is clear: The ferment of 2022 and 2023 has given way to a [slower grind](https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/workforce-digest/the-state-of-the-labor-market-ahead-of-the-fed-s-meeting/) forward. One consequence is a change in how long job postings stick around. During the heady days of the pandemic recovery period, as workers hopped jobs and employers scrambled to fill vacancies, it was not unusual for job postings to be pulled after just a couple weeks. In the summer of 2022---just after the disruptions of the Omicron wave of Covid-19---only about one third of job postings for major U.S. employers stayed online for 30 days or longer. By September 2024, nearly 90% of listings reached their one-month birthday.

The pattern of aging job postings holds across large parts of the labor market (at least among the eight medium-to-large employers included in this analysis: Walmart, Target, CVS, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Etsy, Ebay, and Chewy). There is some difference, however, in terms of the average prestige of existing workers in the roles advertised in job postings. The highest-prestige roles in this group did not see as sharp as a drop in job-ad durations during 2022 as did the middle and lower thirds. This may reflect the fact that roles typically filled by higher-prestige workers---those graduating from the best universities---could require a more careful and specialized search, even amid frothy labor markets.

There are a few reasons why job posting durations might change as the labor market cools. The primary driver is necessity: Employers facing major staffing shortages might feel the need to accept one of the first candidates they encounter, pulling the job ad shortly thereafter. In a cooler job market, with fewer vacancies opening up due to job-hopping, employers may take a bit more time in selecting candidates.

The connection between heat in the labor market and job-ad durations shows up in a few ways. One is in how the age of job listings varies with local unemployment. When we group every monthly state-level unemployment rate between 2022 and late 2024, a trend emerges: Higher unemployment coincides with a greater share of job ads hitting the one-month mark.

There is also a clear relationship between labor market strength and listing durations when we use a more fine-grained measure of labor demand than the state-wide unemployment rate. Using Revelio workforce dynamics data, it is possible to estimate the monthly turnover each company experiences in a given state for each of the 100 or so roles its workers fill (the total varies by company). This measure of turnover has broadly fallen since 2022 as the labor market has softened. Correspondingly, companies have let job listings linger online longer.

The consequences for workers are a mixed bag. When employers have the luxury to be choosier, workers lose leverage in wage negotiations. Workers with less experience or education stand to lose out even more, since employers now have more time to wait for the most qualified applicants---while putting all applicants through a [lengthier interview process](https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/social/job-applicants-prepare-to-be-probed-tested-and-ghosted/). The data on job posting durations might also be related to the emerging trend of [ghost jobs](https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/macro/ghost-job-postings/), or listings that employers publish for reasons other than immediate hiring, for instance, to gather intelligence or keep up growth appearances. 

If there is a silver lining for job seekers, itâ€™s that when job postings stay up longer, potential applicants may have a bit more time to find or answer a job ad. But this is likely small comfort to workers wishing for a return to the bountiful opportunities of prior years.
