<h2 id="as-the-labor-market-cools-job-postings-are-growing-stale">As the
labor market cools, job postings are growing stale</h2>
<p>Employers aren’t rushing to fill vacancies anymore</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>With the labor market slowing, job seekers now encounter a
growing share of listings that stay up for a month or
more.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Job postings have aged throughout the labor market, but
especially for low- and mid-tier roles.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The rise in job-ad durations is tied to declines in labor
market churn, as more employees stay put and fewer vacancies open
up.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By now, the story of the post-pandemic U.S. labor market is clear:
The ferment of 2022 and 2023 has given way to a <a
href="https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/workforce-digest/the-state-of-the-labor-market-ahead-of-the-fed-s-meeting/">slower
grind</a> forward. One consequence is a change in how long job postings
stick around. During the heady days of the pandemic recovery period, as
workers hopped jobs and employers scrambled to fill vacancies, it was
not unusual for job postings to be pulled after just a couple weeks. In
the summer of 2022—just after the disruptions of the Omicron wave of
Covid-19—only about one third of job postings for major U.S. employers
stayed online for 30 days or longer. By September 2024, nearly 90% of
listings reached their one-month birthday.</p>
<iframe src="fig1.html" width="725" height="575" style="border: none; overflow: hidden;">
</iframe>
<p>The pattern of aging job postings holds across large parts of the
labor market (at least among the eight medium-to-large employers
included in this analysis: Walmart, Target, CVS, Dollar Tree, Dollar
General, Etsy, Ebay, and Chewy). There is some difference, however, in
terms of the average prestige of existing workers in the roles
advertised in job postings. The highest-prestige roles in this group did
not see as sharp as a drop in job-ad durations during 2022 as did the
middle and lower thirds. This may reflect the fact that roles typically
filled by higher-prestige workers—those graduating from the best
universities—could require a more careful and specialized search, even
amid frothy labor markets.</p>
<iframe src="fig2.html" width="725" height="575" style="border: none; overflow: hidden;">
</iframe>
<p>There are a few reasons why job posting durations might change as the
labor market cools. The primary driver is necessity: Employers facing
major staffing shortages might feel the need to accept one of the first
candidates they encounter, pulling the job ad shortly thereafter. In a
cooler job market, with fewer vacancies opening up due to job-hopping,
employers may take a bit more time in selecting candidates.</p>
<p>The connection between heat in the labor market and job-ad durations
shows up in a few ways. One is in how the age of job listings varies
with local unemployment. When we group every monthly state-level
unemployment rate between 2022 and late 2024, a trend emerges: Higher
unemployment coincides with a greater share of job ads hitting the
one-month mark.</p>
<iframe src="fig3.html" width="725" height="575" style="border: none; overflow: hidden;">
</iframe>
<p>There is also a clear relationship between labor market strength and
listing durations when we use a more fine-grained measure of labor
demand than the state-wide unemployment rate. Using Revelio workforce
dynamics data, it is possible to estimate the monthly turnover each
company experiences in a given state for each of the 100 or so roles its
workers fill (the total varies by company). This measure of turnover has
broadly fallen since 2022 as the labor market has softened.
Correspondingly, companies have let job listings linger online
longer.</p>
<iframe src="fig4.html" width="725" height="575" style="border: none; overflow: hidden;">
</iframe>
<p>The consequences for workers are a mixed bag. When employers have the
luxury to be choosier, workers lose leverage in wage negotiations.
Workers with less experience or education stand to lose out even more,
since employers now have more time to wait for the most qualified
applicants—while putting all applicants through a <a
href="https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/social/job-applicants-prepare-to-be-probed-tested-and-ghosted/">lengthier
interview process</a>. The data on job posting durations might also be
related to the emerging trend of <a
href="https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/macro/ghost-job-postings/">ghost
jobs</a>, or listings that employers publish for reasons other than
immediate hiring, for instance, to gather intelligence or keep up growth
appearances.</p>
<p>If there is a silver lining for job seekers, it’s that when job
postings stay up longer, potential applicants may have a bit more time
to find or answer a job ad. But this is likely small comfort to workers
wishing for a return to the bountiful opportunities of prior years.</p>
